# Resource-Aware-Implementation-of-Shor-s-Algorithm
Shor’s algorithm faces scalability issues due to memory bottlenecks and inefficient classical post-processing in near-term implementations. This work optimizes Shor’s for 34 qubits (can be scaled to higher number of qubits) via GPU acceleration with validated resource profiling.
